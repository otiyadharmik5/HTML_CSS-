# Figma Hero Conversion (template)
Files in this project:
- index.html
- styles.css

What I built:
- A responsive hero section + features section scaffold that follows modern design patterns
- Clean, commented CSS and simple JS for mobile nav toggle

Important notes / limitations:
- The uploaded zip contained a single `.fig` Figma file. The execution environment cannot parse `.fig` files or fetch assets/fonts from Figma automatically.
- Because I couldn't access the Figma layers or exported assets, this project is a high-quality, responsive template that matches typical hero layouts, but is not guaranteed to be pixel-perfect to your original Figma file.
- To make this project pixel-perfect I need one of the following:
  1) Exported assets (SVGs/PNGs) and a screenshot of the Figma artboard so I can match exact sizes and fonts.
  2) A Figma share link with edit/view access so I can inspect sizes and export assets (you can paste that link here).

How to host (quick):
1. Push this folder to a GitHub repo.
2. In GitHub, go to Settings → Pages → Source → Select `main` branch and `/ (root)`, then Save. The site will be available at `https://<your-username>.github.io/<repo-name>/` within a few minutes.
3. Or drag & drop the folder to Netlify or Vercel for instant hosting.

If you'd like, I can:
- Convert the exact Figma file to pixel-perfect HTML/CSS if you provide exported assets or a Figma share link.
- Produce a single-file HTML (inline CSS) if your submission requires a one-file deliverable for quick upload.
